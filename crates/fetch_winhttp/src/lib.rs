//! WinHTTP-based HTTP transport for the [`fetch`] HTTP client.
//!
//! This Windows-only crate adds a `WinHTTP` transport constructor to
//! [`HttpClient`]. Callers supply the clock, memory pool, and telemetry sink
//! required by the transport through [`WinHttpDeps`].
//!
//! WinHTTP-specific TLS and timeout configuration is available through
//! [`WinHttpTlsConfig`] and [`WinHttpOptions`]. Independently built clients use
//! isolated transport resources, while cloned clients share their resources.
//!
//! Requests are serviced through the operating system's
//! [WinHTTP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/using-winhttp)
//! API.
