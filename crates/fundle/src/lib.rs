//! Safe compile-time dependency injection for Rust.
//!
//! Fundle is a dependency injection system for service libraries that provides compile-time
//! safety and zero-cost abstractions for managing complex dependency graphs in large
//! applications.
//!
//! # What is Dependency Injection?
//!
//! Dependency injection is an implementation technique for the Inversion of Control design pattern,
//! where objects receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally.
//! This pattern is essential for:
//!
//! - **Testability**: Replace real implementations with mocks during testing
//! - **Modularity**: Decouple components from their concrete dependencies
//! - **Configuration**: Switch implementations based on environment (dev/prod/test)
//! - **Maintainability**: Change implementations without modifying dependent code
//!
//! In large enterprise applications, components often depend on many services like databases,
//! loggers, configuration systems, external APIs, and other business logic components. Managing
//! these dependencies manually becomes unwieldy as the application grows. Dependency injection
//! is intended to help.
//!
//! # Classic Dependency Injection
//!
//! Classic dependency injection frameworks (like those found in Java/.NET) suffer from several
//! fundamental issues:
//!
//! - **Runtime Failures**. Dependencies are resolved at runtime, meaning missing or misconfigured dependencies only
//!   surface when an application starts (or worse, when specific code paths execute).
//!
//! - **Virtual Dispatch Overhead**. Traditional DI relies heavily on interfaces and virtual dispatch, introducing performance
//!   overhead for every method call.
//!
//! - **Complex Configuration**. Setting up DI containers requires extensive boilerplate and configuration that's often
//!   error-prone and hard to maintain.
//!
//! # How Fundle Works
//!
//! Fundle takes a fundamentally different approach from classic dependency injection frameworks by
//! using Rust's type system and compile-time guarantees.
//!
//! - **Compile-Time Safety**. All dependencies must be satisfied at compile time. Missing dependencies result in compilation
//!   errors, not runtime panics.
//!
//! - **Zero-Cost Abstraction**. Fundle generates code that compiles down to simple struct field accesses with no virtual
//!   dispatch. Dependencies are resolved statically, resulting in the same performance as hand-written code. And monomorphization
//!   ensures no runtime overhead.
//!
//! - **Dependency Graph Validation**. Fundle automatically validates that dependency graphs are acyclic and that all required
//!   dependencies are available when constructing each component:
//!   As applications grow to hundreds of components, Fundle's compile-time validation prevents
//!   the "integration hell" common in large codebases. New team members can't accidentally
//!   break the dependency graph.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//!
//! - **Type-safe builder pattern** - Each field must be set exactly once before building
//! - **Dependency injection** - Fields can access previously set fields during construction
//! - **Automatic `AsRef` implementations** - Generated for unique field types
//! - **Multiple setter variants** - Regular, try (fallible), async, and async-try setters
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[derive(Clone)]
//! # pub struct Logger {}
//! # #[derive(Clone)]
//! # pub struct Config {}
//! # #[derive(Clone)]
//! # pub struct Database { }
//! # impl Logger { fn new() -> Self { Self {} } }
//! # impl Config { fn new_with_logger(logger: impl AsRef<Logger>) -> Self { Self {} } }
//! # impl Database { fn connect(url: &str, logger: impl AsRef<Logger>) -> Self { Self { } } }
//! #
//! #[fundle::bundle]
//! pub struct AppState {
//!     logger: Logger,
//!     database: Database,
//!     config: Config,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let app = AppState::builder()
//!         .logger(|_| Logger::new())
//!         .config(|x| Config::new_with_logger(x))
//!         .database(|x| Database::connect("postgresql://localhost", x))
//!         .build();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Name Origin
//!
//! The name `fundle::bundle` comes from the "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" episode of the American version of The Office.

// Internal helpers. These are used for type state pattern used by the `bundle` macro.
// Specifically, if you do
//
// ```rust
// #[fundle::bundle]
// struct AppState {
//     logger: Logger,
//     config: Config,
// }
// ```
// It will generate an `AppStateBuilder<LOGGER, CONFIG>` and then use `Set` and `NotSet`
// as marker types to govern when `AsRef` and various helpers are implemented.
