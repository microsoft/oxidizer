# Time Examples

These examples demonstrate the features and capabilities of Oxidizer Time primitives:

- [Basic](basic.rs): Quick intro into time primitives.
- [Clock](clock.rs): More examples on how to use the `Clock` type, `Stopwatch` and `Timer`.
- [Timestamp](timestamp.rs): Working with `Timestamp` that is used for UTC timestamps. This includes parsing and formatting of standard UTC timestamp formats.
- [Data](data.rs): Demonstrates how to integrate `Timestamp` with serializable data.
- [Interop Jiff ](interop_jiff.rs): Showcases the interoperability of Oxidizer time primitives with the [jiff](https://docs.rs/jiff) crate. This includes formatting the timestamps into time zone aware date times.
- [Interop Chrono ](interop_chrono.rs): Showcases the interoperability of Oxidizer time primitives with the [chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono) crate. This includes formatting the timestamps into time zone aware date times.
- [Interop Time ](interop_chrono.rs): Showcases the interoperability of Oxidizer time primitives with the [time](https://docs.rs/time) crate. This includes formatting the timestamps into time zone aware date times.
- [Clock Control](clock_control.rs): Demonstrates how to use the `ClockControl` type to controll the flow of time.
